# Expo Camera `getImageData()` Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API's `getImageData()` function for custom image processing. The function intermittently returns incorrect or empty pixel data, resulting in image processing failures.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on a physical device or emulator (issues are more likely on a physical device).
4. Capture an image.
5. Observe the potentially corrupted or missing image data when processed.

## Potential Causes and Workarounds

The root cause of this bug is unknown, but it might be related to asynchronous operations, memory management within Expo, or interactions with the underlying camera hardware. Workarounds may involve:

* **Using a different image processing library:**  Explore alternative libraries that may handle image data more reliably.
* **Error handling and retries:**  Implement robust error handling to catch `getImageData()` failures and retry the operation.
* **Image downscaling:**  Reduce the image resolution before processing to potentially minimize issues.
* **Reporting the bug:** File a bug report with Expo to help them address the issue.
