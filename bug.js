This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom image processing.  The issue arises when attempting to access pixel data from a captured image using `canvas.getImageData()`. The function returns incorrect or empty data, leading to unexpected behavior in image manipulation routines. This is especially noticeable when using the image in combination with other libraries or using computationally intensive image processing operations. The error does not consistently occur and may depend on image size, device, or other factors. It can manifest as unexpected colors, missing sections of the image, or a complete failure to process the image.
